Backup script for MediaWiki. Database dump command is for only MySQL databases.
Actually, it's a general backup script and can be used for another purposes. But it's written to back mediawiki up shortly.
If you would like to use, you have to change a few variable value in script.

* DATABASE_NAME: Your MediaWiki database name.
* DATABASE_USERNAME: MySQL user name
* DATABASE_PASSWORD: MySQL password
* BACKUP_PATH: It is where you want backing up to

I use MAMP on OSX. Because of that, i have set some of paths according to MAMP. You can change these for your use.
